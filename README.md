# Github-Data-Forecasting
An interactive dashboard that retrieves GitHub repository data using the GitHub API, visualizes trends with charts, and forecasts key metrics using machine learning models like LSTM, Facebook Prophet, and StatsModel. Built with Flask, React, and Docker.


## üöÄ Features

- **GitHub API Integration**: Fetches repository data (issues, stars, forks, commits, pull requests, contributors, etc.).
- **Data Visualization**: Line charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts for repo trends.
- **Machine Learning Forecasting**:
  - LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)
  - Facebook Prophet
  - StatsModel
- **Microservices Architecture**: Flask for backend, React for frontend, deployed using Docker & Google Cloud.

## üìä Data Visualization

- **Line Chart**: Issues over time for each repository.
- **Bar Charts**:
  - Issues created per month for each repository.
  - Stars, forks, and closed issues per repository.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Created vs. closed issues.
- **Forecasting Charts**:
  - Predicted trends for issues, pull requests, commits, branches, contributors, and releases.

## üîÆ Forecasting Objectives

Using ML models, we predict:
1. The day of the week with the maximum number of issues created.
2. The day of the week with the maximum number of issues closed.
3. The month with the highest number of closed issues.
4. Future trends for issues, pulls, commits, branches, contributors, and releases.


### Prerequisites
